## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

Learnt about the basic concepts of human-centred complex systems, system boundaries and models through the lecturers presentation

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I now have a more defined understanding of a system and its structure

### What insights have I gained?

I have gained valuable insight into the different systems and models 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I’ve realised my strengths is my mental ability to stay focused through class however, my weakness would be me being unorganised

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?



## Week 2 

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt about the many models of ways to make it effective when analysing information which ultimately improves our decision making.

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
As many model thinking provides great insight through its data analysing and processes, this knowledge is valuable and leads to the most optimal decision to be made and so I now understand why many model thinking is applied to many areas in society.

### What insights have I gained?
I have learnt from this workshop that I should apply this concept towards areas in my life where a critical decision must be made, that way I can ensure I make the most optimal decision with hopes of an extraordinary outcome. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have found it hard to stay organised and keep up with all the activities, however I will definitely catch up and be more organised through a dedicated learning strategy.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
We found that it may be hard to focus in online classes due to the tempting distractions, however, we all accepted this was a challenge and we made sure to discuss again once the workshop had ended.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I will make sure to stay organised and focused so that I absorb all the important information that will help me complete this course.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The diversity prediction theorem takes a mathematical approach in the wisdom of the crowd to predict the crowd. I believe that with a mathematical approach as the foundation, results and percentages will be a very accurate prediction.



## Week 3 

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we focussed on people’s behaviours and decisions through different models which may analyse their reasoning.

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
People’s behaviours can be very hard to predict and sometimes can have no logic at all. However, human behaviour can sometimes be predicted as a majority such as the prospect theory where one option is more optimal than the other.

### What insights have I gained?
The insights I have gained is that although one option might seem like the more obvious or perhaps the “better” choice, there will always be a select few that make a different choice, and this is just due to the human nature of being unique in their own way.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have always been intrigued with human behaviours and so I found this workshop easy to get through and stayed focussed, however I still need to make sure I am better prepared and organised for class.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
Challenges I encountered were to stay organised again, I must better prepare. Our team all around fairly enjoyed this week’s workshop and understanding the many concepts presented. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I must prepare greater in advance to workshops to ensure I can get the most out of these informative sessions.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The rational model was very interesting to me because given the example that you found $100 while walking down the street with a friend, the rational option would be to keep it all, however, you may want to halve it with that friend. This human nature of altruism is very intriguing and can really change the way your friend perceives you.



## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learned about system dynamic models and gained deep insight to what systems are actually capable of. We also applied this concept to real life to help predict the outcome of the different strategies that can be used to combat Covid-19.

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
That systems are defined by their interrelationships such that a system will cease function when a part of it is taken away. This is because my assumption was that systems would just be unable to operate at the most optimal level but wouldn’t cease function.

### What insights have I gained?
I understood that agent-based models are extraordinarily effective at predicting the many outcomes. These models also give valuable information and knowledge to agents to properly adapt to an environment.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I feel like after week 4 my strengths and weaknesses have still stayed the same, however, I have been working on staying organised and balancing my entire workload.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
I think for the most part, my struggles have stayed the same, but I will persevere and make sure to grasp a greater understanding of these important systems and models which can be applied to real life situations.	

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I think I should dedicate more time to revise the informative content to allow for a better understanding and fuel my innovative mind.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I felt the agent-based model to be very interesting since it will be necessary in the future. As technology becomes more advanced and innovative, the different simulations represented through agents can allow for a greater understanding of different situations.



## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
This week’s content was about aggregating decisions and behaviour where we looked at probabilities and distributions which can be used to comprehends patterns and outcomes and be applied to real-life problems.

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
I now understand the 2 major types of variables which is necessary for choosing the correct probability distribution model. The discrete random variable which is a number that is countable and a continuous random variable which is uncountable. 

### What insights have I gained?
This week we watched a TED Talk and I have found the video very informative and I now understand the critical idea of innovation and how it impacts the survival of cities.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I did not feel like this week was different from previous weeks, we all kept consistent discussions in our group chat and I realised that I should take more initiative and throw myself into the conversation more.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
We didn’t really run into many obstacles this week and I felt like it was generally fairly good that we stay consistent with our work.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I should definitely be more proactive in chats and activities to make sure that everyone plays their necessary role and contributing to the group.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I found that statistics is a very useful source for data as it takes a numerical approach to display data with probabilities. For example, this summarised data is able to provide a precise guess on the chances of certain events occurring.



## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we talked about how complex systems evolve over time and more importantly the Markov models. 

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
I now know about the importance of Markov models and Markov chains which are mathematical systems that move from one state to another. These Markov chains can be applied to real life situations through computer simulations which can be used to model big phenomena and when used by meteorologists can be very beneficial.

### What insights have I gained?
We touched upon the assignment and I now understand how these models will be necessary for this task as multiple models can be used and applied to a given problem or situation to acquire informative data.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I realised that I may not be very good at group tasks as it is very different from working by yourself. I did find out that I can keep a positive mindset despite everything going on outside of uni.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
We had trouble deciding on the topic and so we decided to take a vote to see what the majority would like to work on. I feel like this was handled efficiently and we made a good choice. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I should definitely take more initiative to ensure that our group stays on top with everyone’s contributions.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I find the Markov chain useful as it can simplify the processes for predicting the future. This mathematical tool can be given the current state of a process and then simply views the future independent of the past.



## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt about the segregation/peer effects models including namely models such as the Granovetter’s model and the Schelling’s segregation model. 

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
The pure coordination game is based off of culture as given by the ketchup example, I now understand why some would store the ketchup in the fridge and not the cupboard or vice versa as in their culture that is how it would’ve been taught and passed down.

### What insights have I gained?
I have a greater understanding of culture and why we can see the society as being “complex”. As culture influences many groups physically and mentally it is hard to assume or predict behaviour as there is no norm.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
As we decided on a topic we should definitely get preparing, however, I have realised that I am still behind in some areas.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
This week was very quiet especially for our group and I feel like I did not handle it very well. I should definitely try to contribute and start discussions to ensure we work at a steady pace on the assignment task.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I should definitely try to coordinate the group as everyone plays a role in this group and by taking initiative, we can definitely get the results we desire. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The measuring of segregation is definitely amusing as it takes a numerical approach to calculating segregation. Mathematical approaches means that we can learn an accurate measure of the segregation which can in turn be valuable data.



## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week?
This week was about working on our group portfolio and so we did not learn any new content. 

### What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
I now know that we have finished up on the content for this subject and that the rest of the semester, our focus will be on completing our GitHub report.

### What insights have I gained?
This week I’ve understood that I must improve myself to make sure this group can do well. I definitely need to pick up my pace soon or we will fall behind further.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week showed that I am easily able to lose focus as our work through class time was not very efficient. I also definitely struggle with being the person responsible for coordinating our group.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
This week it was only one group member with me in class and it was very inefficient. I definitely should have messaged and checked up on our other group member to see if they would be joining and organising what we should part of our report we should be working on.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I should definitely try to coordinate the group better as it is my responsibility as a leader. This will help our group communication and so we will be able to decide on our work together.



## Week 9

### What have I learnt this week?
This week was about working on our group portfolio and so we did not learn any new content. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week was overall not bad. My strengths and weaknesses definitely still feel the same but I am still optimistic that there is improvement. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did (I/My team) handle them?
This week’s challenges was sort of the same as last weeks but we were somewhat productive and got some work done. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Again I still need to improve on myself by coordinating the group better and being responsible for the most part of our group. This is something I am working on and definitely be better at in the near future.
